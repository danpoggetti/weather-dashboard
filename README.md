<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I was tasked to create a weather dashboard app so that a user can see the weather forecast for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly.

I want a user to be able to:
<ol>
<li>When a user searchs for a city:<br>They are presented with the current and future weather conditions for the searched city and that city searched gets placed into a search history.</li>
<li>When a user views the current weather conditions for the city:<br>They are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.</li>
<li>When a user views future weather condtions for that city:<br>They are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representing weather condtions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.</li>
<li>When a user clicks on a city in the search history:<br>They will be presented with current and future conditions for the city.</li>
</ol>
